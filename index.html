				<h1>Jasmine Adams, LCSW Private Practive Therapy</h1>
				<p>Thank you for taking a moment to look into my therapeutic services. I am sure you feel overwhelmed with trying to pick the right therapist for you, it can be scary to pick up that phone. In knowing that the relationship between therapist and client is very important, I offer a discounted "meet and greet" session where you can get a chance to learn about my services and also see if my style is a good fit for your needs.</p>
				<p>As a Therapist, I have been providing individual, family, group and couples therapy for over 11 years. I am a solution-focused, strength based, client centered eclectic therapist. I believe you are the expert to your own needs and meet my clients where they need me. I aim to provide a safe and supportive environment where you can tackle challenging life obstacles, strained relationships, past traumas, or current stressors.</p>
				<p>My belief is that therapy can offer a space to understand yourself better and bring awareness to the choices and decisions you make. I strive to have each client see their true potential in themselves and to have the tools to be better equipped to handle life's natural curve balls. I would be honored to support you through your journey, give me a call today.</p>
